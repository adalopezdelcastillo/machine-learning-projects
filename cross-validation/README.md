# Cross-Validation and Model Comparison

This notebook explores model evaluation techniques using cross-validation.

## Contents

- Train/test split
- K-Fold cross-validation
- Performance comparison between models
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy and related scores)

The goal of this practice was to understand how cross-validation provides a more robust estimate of model performance compared to a single train/test split.
