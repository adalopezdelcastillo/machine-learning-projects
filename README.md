# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains practical machine learning exercises developed during coursework.

The notebooks focus on fundamental concepts in supervised learning, model evaluation, fairness metrics, and reinforcement learning, implemented using Python and scikit-learn.

## Topics Covered

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Linear vs RBF kernel comparison
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance analysis

### Cross-Validation
- Train/test split
- K-Fold cross-validation
- Model comparison

### Decision Trees
- Gini impurity vs Entropy
- Tree construction and interpretation

### Fairness in Machine Learning
- Statistical Parity Difference (SPD)
- Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD)
- Fairness-performance trade-offs

### Reinforcement Learning
- Introduction to Q-learning
- Q-table implementation
- Policy learning process

## Tools Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

These notebooks were developed individually as part of coursework and are shared for portfolio purposes.
